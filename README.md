# OOPTeamGenerator

- The task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, so a unit test was written for every part of the code and ensured that it passed each test. 
- Your application should use Jest for running the unit tests and Inquirer for collecting input from the user.
